Should the graduates undertake more than one Degree (e.g. Dual Degree programme), they have been classified based on their first Degree.\n
^ Data is based on a sample size of fewer than 30 respondents.\n
** No data is shown due to the small number of graduates and/or low response rates.\n
(#) Data on Law, Medical, Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences & Chinese Medicine graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated one year ago (e.g. for 2018 GES survey, data is obtained from 2017 graduates) after they have completed their one-year practical law course/pupillage/housemanship/first-year residency/practical training. Data on Architecture graduates are obtained from a follow-up survey on those who graduated 3 years ago (e.g. for 2018 GES survey, data is obtained from 2015 graduates) after they have completed their practical training.\n
